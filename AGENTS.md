# Portfolio Update Instructions: The "Delivery Architect" Pivot

## Objective
Update the professional portfolio at `lonesome-data.github.io` to shift the narrative from a General Management/GTM focus to a **Technical Delivery & Systems Architecture** focus. The goal is to highlight the user's "Subjective" leadership style, deterministic modeling philosophy, and the transition from the Marine Corps to high-level engineering.

## 1. Source File
- **Target File:** `index.md` (or the primary Markdown file for the site landing page).

## 2. Header Update (Professional Summary)
Ensure the top-level summary is exactly as follows:

> **Strategic AI Transformation Leader & Enterprise AI Strategist**
> Technical Executive and delivery architect specializing in the transition of complex R&D into production-ready AI systems. I lead 'manager of manager' structures to scale global delivery capabilities, prioritizing deterministic modeling and systemic reliability over non-deterministic inferencing. Leveraging a background in U.S. Marine Corps command and an MS in Computer Science, I architect resilient AI engines for highly regulated and high-velocity commercial sectors alike.

## 3. New Content Injection (About & Philosophy)
Paste the following block immediately **AFTER** the Professional Summary and **BEFORE** the "Strategic & Tech Expertise" section.

## Marine Corps to Code: A Journey in Systems

My career began in the **U.S. Marine Corps**, where I learned that high-stakes missions succeed or fail based on the reliability of the underlying system. Transitioning from the field to the classroom as a Faculty member at the **U.S. Naval Academy**, I realized my true passion lay in the architecture, the logic, and the deterministic variables that drive mission readiness. With an **MS in Computer Science**, I don’t just manage technical teams; I cultivate an engineering culture where precision is the baseline and "working backwards" from a problem is the standard.

I am a **technical realist**. In an era of rapid AI experimentation, I focus on the intersection of agentic velocity and predictive accuracy. My approach is driven by a fundamental data science conviction: while agentic workflows are transformative for optimizing administrative and low-order tasks, true mission outcomes—readiness, risk, and efficiency—are achieved through rigorous, **deterministic modeling**. I thrive in autonomous, expert-driven environments where I can lead specialized technical cohorts in building stable, audit-ready solutions.

## 4. Operational Constraints
- **Responsive Design:** Maintain the `philosophy-container` flexbox properties to ensure the cards stack correctly on mobile devices.
- **Visual Consistency:** Ensure the `#f6f8fa` background color and blue border-left align with the existing GitHub/minimalist aesthetic.
- **Clean Markdown:** Do not introduce extra `#` headers that might break the existing Table of Contents or site navigation.
