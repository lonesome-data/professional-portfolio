# Sean Forester - Professional Portfolio

**[Live Portfolio](https://lonesome-data.github.io/professional-portfolio/)**

This repository contains the source code for my professional portfolio website, showcasing my expertise in Strategic AI Transformation, Technical Innovation, and Executive Leadership.

## Features
- **Modern Glassmorphism Design**: High-end aesthetic with dynamic CSS gradients.
- **Strategic & Technical Breakdown**: Clear delineation between executive leadership and deep-tech innovation.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully optimized for various screen sizes.
- **Integrated Analytics**: Google Analytics tracking for professional engagement.

## Resume Management
The file `resume.html` in this repository is a static baseline.

- **Maintenance Note:** The resume.html file is a static baseline. It is manually curated and is not automatically updated by the resume_creator repository. To update the public resume, changes must be manually ported and committed here.

### How it Works
The Resume link is generated by a Client-Side Rendering Engine. The browser initializes a static HTML shell (resume.html), which is then populated by data.js and injected into specific DOM IDs by the logic in app.js. For the resume to render correctly, all four core files (resume.html, resume.css, data.js, and app.js) must be maintained in the same root directory.
